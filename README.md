## **About Me**  

- **Currently focus**: Python, Machine learning
- **Occupation**: Aspiring network security pro, but also a grey-hat enthusiast.
- **MBTI**: INFP
- **What I Love**: Coding, rainy days, cozy corners.

- **Hobbies**:
  - Python and algorithms - because a little bit of magic lies in every line of code.
  - Reading, especially when I can escape into fictional worlds, where rules bend and hearts always find their way home.
  - Gaming - anything that lets me dive into worlds where I can be anyone, or no one at all. I've got a soft spot for *Cyberpunk 2077* and Johnny Silverhand, and there's a bit of Night City nostalgia running through my veins, blending the chaotic beauty of that world with the order I create through the code.ðŸ‘¾
